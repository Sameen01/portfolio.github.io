                        <p>The day I was born, people passed comments and hearing this made wonder why canâ€™t be a daughter taken as the backbone of her
                            family. From that day, I made sure that, in future, I will accomplish in the feild of computing. Choosing a degree in Computer Science was not easy for me, as one of the best CS institutes was
                            FAST-NUCES, which was located about 30 km away from my home. Surprisingly, I ended up in the top list
                            after the admission test, and here at FAST NUCES, I am a well known student in my university, who
                            possess a passion for excelling in the tech field. I have a capability to prove myself in this conservative society which will
                            make me more empowered. </p>

                        <p>I have mentioned above, I am a recognized person in my university, as I am the Vice President of ACM FAST-NUCES Karachi.
                             This society helps the tech community, especially students, to
                            showcase their skills, such as web development, app development and AI. This will be shared
                            around my university and will motivate a lot of students to keep on trying for a better future in the tech
                            world. I will make sure that all of the female students in the institute get in touch with such conferences and
                            get this kind of exposure, especially the ones from the unskilled background. I am associated with other
                            societies and events too; a huge part of which includes organizing and engaging with several IT people.
                            The main benefit of it is to gain and convey guidance regarding career paths, and the way to
                            implement tech skills in the not so tech progressive environment of my country. For pursuing and
                            expanding career in IT, I need access to a platform where I can be trained by the international software
                            houses and make things easy by making a pathway and setting an example for the youth.</p>
